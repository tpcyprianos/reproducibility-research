    "# Best Practices\n",
    "The goal of this document is to present some importants tips about reproducible research. The description here shows what worked and what didn't work during my research in the course classes IA369-Z from FEEC Unicamp. Here you will find *my lessons learned* during the course, and I hope to help you with your research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reproducible Research\n",
    "You must make Reproducible Research during your research, it is a way to research, and it is not an end step, like: \"Ok, now I will put my files on Github and everybody will be able to reproduce my experiments\". Reproducible research is a practical approach that will helps you to improve the **quality** of your work, to **validate** your finds and to **do relevant contributions in your area**. When others researchers can reproduce your experiment, they can use and create from your work. Even they find problems in your experiment, surely they will let you know, what is a good thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thing, sometimes, we are so concentrate in the validation of our hypothesis, and in the writting (paper) of our insights that we forget report detail steps and decisions (for us obvious), becoming the reproduction impossible (for other researchers and yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "What helped me during the experiments was keep in my mind *\"A human will read my paper, code, and notes.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are still not convinced, please, read theses references: [Useless Studies](http://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2017/01/10/internacional/1484073680_523691.html?id_externo_rsoc=FB_CC),  [Manifesto from Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021).\n",

    "## Resources for Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I hope, you are motivated to do reproducible research, then you can start reading this [10 Simple Rules](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285). \n",
    "\n",
    "After discussions during the classes course, we agreed with following resources of Reproducible Research:\n",
    "* Version Control\n",
    "* Workflow\n",
    "* Data repository\n",
    "* Code development\n",
    "* Documentation\n",
    "* Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "I will comment each element, for being clearer, I will separate the tips in DO (it works) and (DON'T) (it doesn't work):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**---- DO ----**\n",
    "* For me, to design the workflow must be the first step of your research. Even in the beginning, it will help you to think and draw the flow of the research with the inputs, outputs, dependencies and data. Moreover, it will help to plan your research;\n",
    "* Save your editable files (for any tool), certainly, the workflow will change during the process;\n",
    "* [Draw.io](http://draw.io/) is a good tool and is integrated with Git (the integration works very well);\n",
    "\n",
    "**---- DON'T ----**\n",
    "* Do not underestimate this step, even in the first version, put as much detail as possible;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "**---- DO ----**\n",
    "* After plan you research, make a friendship with version control;\n",
    "* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a good and disseminated option (and you will find a lot of documentation);\n",
    "* Select a repository, [Github](https://github.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) are famous ones;\n",
    "* Use the version control DURING your work, making ``commits`` in changes that you want to save;\n",
    "* If you new in git, there are some good guides: [Try Git](https://try.github.io/) and [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/) \n",
    "\n",
    "**---- DON'T ----**\n",
    "* Do not leave to the end of your research put the codes (and related files) in the repository. Make your repository in the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "**---- DO ----**\n",
    "* This is an important step, provide in your repository the raw and/or processed dataset;\n",
    "* Make sure you are clear, in the documentation, about \n",
    "* If you are using dataset from other researcher, you must reference it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**---- DON'T ----**\n",
    "* Do not make manual manipulations in dataset, use codes or scripts to do that. Easily, you can forget this changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Development and Literate Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Literate Programming was a new concept for me, but much important. So, to do Reproducible Research you must understand:\n",
    ">*“Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to humans what we want the computer to do.” Donald Knuth*\n",
    "\n",
    "** ---- DO ----**\n",
    "* Select a good environment to develop your codes and texts (Literate Programming);\n",
    "* [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is a good option. They recommend install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) that comes with Python and Jupyter;\n",
    "* Learn [Markdown](https://blog.da2k.com.br/2015/02/08/aprenda-markdown/), you will use this kind of text to explain your codes and experiments;\n",
    "* Code with [good practices](http://www.devmedia.com.br/boas-praticas-de-programacao/31163?utm_content=buffer1cddf&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer) of programming, that will make the big difference; \n",
    "* Report libraries installed to execute your codes (including versions).\n",
    "* In your files put a cell with text explaining the decision or step, after that the cell(s) with code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**---- DON'T ----**\n",
    "* When you install the Anaconda, make sure you set the right path, it looks like a fool thing, but I installed thinking \"I will select any folder after I can change\", but when I needed to define the paths to repository, I couldn't and I have to desinstall and install again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "I considered as documentation my official paper, so thinking to be more productive, I used the Jupyter Notebook. The experience was good, you can put in the same file cells with codes and texts. The problem was when converted Markdown in [TEX (LaTeX)](https://www.latex-project.org/), it was not productive as I have imagined, I had to correct many things in the file. Although, it was worth it at for the first version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in your mind: \"The Notebook file will be converted in Markdown, and then in TEX\". Well, you can ask: why have we to convert in TEX? Because, you will want to put citation of references and figures, use templates and format your text. Markdown has limitations for these needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommendation: If you will put in your paper many code cells, then use Jupyter Notebook and make the convertions **otherwise, write directly in LaTeX**. If your case is the first one:\n",
    "\n",
    "**---- DO ----**\n",
    "* Create your [bib tex](http://www.bibtex.org/) file with your references; \n",
    "* Write your paper (in Jupyter Notebook) with the LaTeX command of refence of figures: `\\ref{}` and citations `\\cite{}`;\n",
    "* Convert your file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter nbconvert --to markdown <jupyter.ipynb> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pandoc -f markdown -t latex <filename>.md -o filename.tex\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). It is an online tool to create, edit and share LaTeX files in a collaborative way (I recommend); \n",
    "* Open your tex file generated and make the corrections (figures, lists and so on);\n",
    "\n",
    "**---- DON'T ----**\n",
    "* Do not leave to the end of your research, the documentation needs to be build gradually;\n",
    "* There are some resources that make sense to be in paper and others do not. Do not put codes that do not make sense in paper. For example, a call to code file, or codes which do not have an output readable (table, figure, etc.);\n",
    "* There is this reference to [Update Overleaf from a Jupyter Notebook](https://medium.com/thoughts-philosophy-writing/how-to-update-overleaf-from-a-juypter-notebook-5469b1405fdc), I used, but it was not productive... I copied manually files many times; \n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "Based on my experience (including the course classes), the environment is the main limitation to reproduce computational research. We know that softwares have releases and dependencies and these can generate problems (e.g. compatibility). The options of environments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Local - It is not a safe option. You have to report all dependencies and versions (including save as backups of installers);\n",
    "2. Virtual Machine - It is a good option, but you have the problem of size. Who will reproduce your research, will need have access to good Internet connection;\n",
    "3. [Docker](http://docker.com/) - It is the best option! It uses the concept of containers (I recommend strongly).\n",
    "\n",
    "I used Local and Docker environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "**---- DO ----**\n",
    "* I recommend you learn about Docker (Some references: [Docker Basics](https://gitlab.com/daitan-learn/docker-basics), [Docker Lab Lessons](http://labs.play-with-docker.com/),[Blog](http://www.diego-garcia.info/2015/02/15/docker-por-onde-comecar/), [Mundo Docker](http://www.mundodocker.com.br/tag/docker-no-windows/), [Tutorials](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/como-instalar-e-utilizar-o-docker-primeiros-passos-pt), [Blog ](https://woliveiras.com.br/posts/Criando-uma-imagem-Docker-personalizada/))\n",
    "* Important to know: **Image** is an environment configured and **Container** is an instance of image running in your machine;\n",
    "* Verify if the appplications you need in your project are already in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). You can find images ready to use with the complete environment;\n",
    "* Make all your experiments (if possible) using containers, in others words, configure your development environment using image instead of local;\n",
    "* You can use different images for each application you need (e.g. database, programming environment) and run them in parallel;\n",
    "* When you run an image, verify the corrects parameters in `run` command (ports, volume mapping);\n",
    "* The command `docker run <image> -it` means you want interativity and link with the container's shell. On the other hand, the command `docker run <image> -d`, means you want run the image in background (take care, for newer in Docker, the terminal will not explicitly warn that the container is up).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**---- DON'T ----**\n",
    "* Don't put the research data in the Docker image. Probably, the data is the main important element of your research, and a container is not persistent.\n",
    "* Don't forget stop and remove the containers after the use:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Verify the containers*:\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker ps -a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stop all containers:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remove all containers:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Recommendations\n",
    "**---- DO ----**\n",
    "* As a final step of your research, when your results and paper are done, create the README files. The instructions in these files are important, make sure you are clear about every step of your research. Ask some collegue to follow your instructions and try to reproduce your experiment (another person will identify confusing explanations).\n",
    "\n",
    "**---- DON'T ----**\n",
    "* Don't put many README files, I did that, and became my instructions confused.\n"
