    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This paper presents an experiment using network social data. The main goal of these experiments is to index data in graph database (GDB) to help analize the metrics colleted from a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "The data from Social Network will be indexed in Graph Database, then data mining techniques will be implemented and some predictions will be extracted. Based on a paper, the first analysis will be the user engagement in posts of a branch page. The focus is understand the analysis model and reproduce on GDB.\n",
